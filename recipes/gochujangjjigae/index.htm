			<h1>Gochujang Jjigae 고추장 찌개</h1>
			<p><em>Adapted from</em></p>
			<p>Gochujang jjigae is a hearty, spicy, oily soup that is fun to eat and, in my opinion, beautiful to look at with its red and green contrasts.</p>
			<p>We will alternate between this and Doenjang jjigae depending on our mood, but most weeks we'll make at least 2 days of soup. This recipe makes 2 servings for 2 days, 4 servings in total. I will prep the ingredients for both days on day 1, so that day 2 is a little more relaxed.</p>
			<p>Some of the ingredients have [A] and [B] tags - this is because the vegetables go in at 2 stages. The [A] pile goes in first, cooks for a while, then the [B] pile. Organizing your ingredients like this while you prep will make execution much easier. Since I'm prepping for 2 days, this means I end up with 2 sets of [A][B] piles: one set for today, one set for tomorrow.</p>
			<p>During the week when we make other rice dishes, I will save the rice water (ssalddeumul 쌀뜨물) in a quart jar, aiming to have 1 jar per 2 servings. This gives enough soup to fill 2 of our large soup bowls, but if you're using smaller bowls, this recipe might need to be scaled back.</p>
			<p>There are two approaches here that I think are worth mentioning. I <em>boil</em> the soup for a shorter amount of time, usually 3 minutes each stage, but you may prefer to <em>simmer</em> for 5-7 minutes in the [A] stage and 3-5 minutes in the [B] stage. I'm not sure which is better, but this recipe takes 90 minutes to make (on day 1), so I have chosen to optimize for speed where I can.</p>
			
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<p>Makes 4 servings</p>
			<h4>For the Soup</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>1tbs cooking oil</li>
				<li>1lb pork, chopped</li>
				<li>1q water or rice water</li>
				<li>2tsp gochugaru</li>
				<li>[A] 1 yukon gold potato</li>
				<li>[A] 1/2 yellow onion</li>
				<li>[A] 3 shiitake mushrooms, or 1 handful of enoki mushrooms <em>optional</em></li>
				<li>[B] 1 zucchini</li>
				<li>[B] 100g tofu</li>
				<li>[B] 6-8 green onion</li>
				<li>0.5c rice, as a side, per serving</li>
				<li>Seasoning for the meat, as desired (garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>For the Soup Base</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>1.5tbs gochujang</li>
				<li>0.5tbs soy sauce</li>
				<li>0.5tbs oyster sauce</li>
				<li>1tsp sugar</li>
				<li>0.5tbs dasida 다시다 or powdered beef bouillion</li>
				<li>1tbs gochugaru</li>
				<li>0.5tbs minced garlic</li>
				<li>0.25tsp black pepper</li>
			</ul>
		
			<h2>Preparation</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Make the rice</strong> so it's ready before your soup will be finished, usually 45-60 minutes beforehand</li>
				<li>When washing the rice, save the rice water (ssalddeumul 쌀뜨물) in a quart jar. This will bring more body and depth to the soup than normal water because of the starch from the rice</li>
				<li><strong>Make the soup base</strong> by mixing all soup base ingredients in a small bowl</li>
				<li>Cut all [A] ingredients into spoon-sized chunks, set aside together</li>
				<li>Cut all [B] ingredients into spoon-sized chunks, set aside together. Keep the white part of the green onion for the soup, and the green part for garnish</li>
				<li>Cut the meat into spoon-sized chunks, keeping in mind that they shrink a bit when cooked. Ensure the meat is dry by patting with a paper towel and seasoning with garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper, as desired.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Put cooking oil in a soup pot over medium heat, and let it get really hot</li>
				<li>Add pork to the pot, distributing the pieces evenly. Let them cook undisturbed until brown on one side, then toss to evenly cook all sides</li>
				<li>Add the soup base to the pot, stirring for 1 minute</li>
				<li>Add the water to the pot, then turn the heat up to high to begin the boil</li>
				<li>Once the water boils, add the [A] ingredients, and boil for 3-5 minutes</li>
				<li>Add the [B] ingredients and boil for 3-5 minutes</li>
				<li>Ladle into bowls, garnish with green onion, and serve with rice</li>
				<li><strong>Clean the pot!</strong> Trust me, do it now while your soup cools down.</li>
			</ol>
