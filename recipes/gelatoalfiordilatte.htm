		<h1>Gelato al Fior di Latte</h1>
		<p><em>Gelato al fior di latte</em> ("The best part of the milk") is to gelato as vanilla is to soft-serve. Its very simple ingredients produce an incredibly nuanced flavor that is sweet, milky, creamy. Similar to french bread, even though the ingredients are few and easy to get, there is much to be mastered in order to pull out those desired flavors. For the best outcome, use the freshest, most local milk and cream!</p>
		<p>Pay close attention to the mixture while it's coming to a boil. If you heat the sugar too fast or too hot, it will burn. This can produce a delicious caramel flavor, but is not the intent of the recipe. If your sugar burns, scrape it up off of the bottom of the saucepan to have nice caramel chunks inside your gelato; optionally, you may need to strain the mixture to remove these.</p>
		<p>My first time making this, we folded in a ribbon of peanut butter and crushed up Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Blueberries or other fruit and honey would also make excellent toppings.</p>
