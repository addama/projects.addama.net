			<h1>Chicken Noodle Soup</h1>
			<h2>Not a recipe, a process</h2>
			<p>I make chicken noodle soup regularly, and it is one of my favorite hobbies. Perfecting the broth, finding the little tweaks to the seasoning and herb, the soup ingredients - there is a lot of depth to what most people see as a simple meal they probably haven't had since they were a kid.</p>
			<p>As it is an ongoing process, and I wouldn't say I'm a professional chef, this cannot be a recipe (yet). This is a description of the process I use every time I go grocery shopping to produce ridiculously good and healthy meals for the next few nights using relatively little money and time investment.</p>
