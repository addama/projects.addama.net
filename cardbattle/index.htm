		<h1>Card Battle</h1>
		<p><em>Card Battle</em> is a 2+ player card game that aims to capture the play concepts in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> while only using a standard playing card deck.</p>
		<p>I was inspired, as with many things, by a late-night Youtube rabbit hole that put me in front of several homebrew card games using playing cards. If what I have made here isn't your jam, these might be:</p>

		</ul>
		
		<h2>Setup</h2>
		
		<p>Each player will need their own deck of playing cards, Jokers included. Each player should ensure that their deck is properly shuffled before beginning play.</p>
		
		<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
		
		<p>Like in <em>Magic</em>, you are a powerful entity that uses Mana to summon Units to fight your enemies and defend you, which you support by casting spells. Unlike <em>Magic</em>, there is no deck-building aspect - each player effectively has the same deck. However, as we know from playing card games, even the same deck never deals out the same way twice.</p>
		
		<h3>Card Piles</h3>
		<p>Each player has the following card piles:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Draw Pile</strong>: This is the face-down pile where you draw cards from</li>
			<li><strong>Discard Pile</strong>: This is a face-up pile where you place cards that are <em>discarded</em> from play, but not <em>removed</em> from the game entirely. The Discard Pile is not hidden, and can be inspected by you</li>
			<li><strong>Void Pile</strong>: This is the face-down pile where you place cards that are <em>removed</em> from the game</li>
			<li><strong>Hand</strong>: These are your current cards that you can play, which you should keep hidden from your opponent</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Cards that you own always move between card piles and play areas that you own. You will never move any of your cards into any of your opponent's card piles or play areas.</p>
		
		<h3>Play Areas</h3>
		<p>Each player has their own play areas, into which cards are played:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Mana Pool</strong>: Each card in your Mana Pool provides Mana that you use to summon Units and cast spells</li>
			<li><strong>Roster</strong>: Face Cards are played into your Roster, where they will fight other Units that your opponent summons into their Roster</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Tapping and Un-tapping</h3>
		<p>Similar to <em>Magic</em>, cards in your Roster and Mana Pool are <em>tapped</em>, or turned sideways, to indicate that they have been used.</p>
		<p><em>Tapped</em> cards are unusable as long as they remain tapped, and are only <em>un-tapped</em> at the beginning of your next turn.</p>
		
		<h3>Discarding and Un-discarding</h3>
		<p>Cards that are <em>discarded</em> are placed face-up onto the top of your Discard Pile. The Discard Pile is still considered "in play," and may be inspected and interacted with.</p>
		<p>Certain mechanics may allow cards that you choose from the Discard Pile to be <em>un-discarded</em> back into your Hand. If there are no cards in your Discard Pile, <em>un-discard</em> actions do nothing.</p>
		
		<h3>Removing and Un-Removing</h3>
		<p>Cards that are <em>removed</em> are taken from the top of the Draw Pile and placed onto the top of the Void Pile. The Void Pile is considered "out of play" and cannot be inspected or interacted with.</p>
		<p>Certain mechanics may allow cards from the top of the Void Pile to be <em>un-removed</em> back onto the top of the Draw Pile. If there are no cards in your Void Pile, <em>un-removal</em> actions do nothing.</p>
		<p>You may not look at the cards that you are <em>removing</em> or <em>un-removing</em>.</p>

		<h2>Mechanics</h2>

		<h3>Player Health</h3>
		<p>Each player's health is represented by the number of cards in their Draw Pile. Damage is dealt to players by <em>removing</em> cards from the Draw Pile. Similarly, <em>un-removing</em> cards is equivalent to healing player damage.</p>
		
		<h3>Types of Card</h3>
		<p>There are three major classifications of cards in <em>Card Battle</em>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Face Cards (K, Q, J, A):</strong> These are your Units, which can be summoned into your Roster</li>
			<li><strong>Number Cards (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10):</strong> These are your spells and equipment</li>
			<li><strong>Jokers</strong>: These have special qualities because of their rarity, and are explained specifically later</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Face Cards, or <em>Units</em>, are played into the Roster, and are your main means of attack and defense. You may only have one Unit of each kind in play at a time, meaning that you can only have a maximum 4 Units in your Roster: one King, one Queen, one Jack, and one Ace. Units come into play <em>tapped</em>.</p>
		<p>Number Cards can be played in three ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Mana</strong>: the card is played into your Mana Pool, permanently providing 1 Mana of its color</li>
			<li><strong>Attachment</strong>: the card is played as an Attachment to a Unit, temporarily modifying its abilities</li>
			<li><strong>Instant</strong>: the card is played for a one-time effect, then <em>discarded</em></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Mana</h3>
		<p>Each card you want to play costs Mana. Mana comes in two colors: Red and Black. Black cards cost black Mana, and red cards cost red Mana.</p>
		<p>Any Number Card may be played into your Mana Pool for free, adding 1 Mana of its color to your Mana Pool permanently. Red cards give red Mana, and black cards give black Mana. Playing Mana does not cost Mana, and there is no limit to how much Mana you can have, but you can only play one Mana per turn. Mana comes into play <em>tapped</em>.</p>
		<p>Aces can be played as a Unit or a Mana depending on how you play them. Once an Ace has been played, it is treated like a normal Face Card, if played into the Roster, or Number Card, if played into the Mana Pool.</p>
		
		<h2>Attachments</h2>
		<p>Number Cards may be played as Attachments to Units in your Roster. Think of this like giving your Units weapons and equipment to use. You can show that a Number Card has been attached to a Unit by stacking it on top of the Unit so that all card markings in the stack are visible.</p>
		<p>You may only attach one of each Spade or Heart to a Unit at any time. You may <em>discard</em> an already attached Spade or Heart to replace it with one you wish to play instead. Attachments may be played on tapped Units.</p>
		<p>The suit of the card determines the effect of the Attachment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Spades</strong> grant attack damage equal to their number</li>
			<li><strong>Hearts</strong> grant health equal to their number</li>
			<li><strong>Diamonds</strong> grant 1 <em>unavoidable</em> damage per Diamond card attached, with no limit to how many can be attached</li>
			<li><strong>Clubs</strong> grant the ability to <em>un-discard</em> 1 card when the attached Unit is <em>discarded</em>, with no limit to how many can be attached</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If a Unit is used to attack or defend, all of its Attachments are <em>discarded</em> once the combat has been resolved.</p>
		
		<h2>Instants</h2>
		<p>Number Cards may be played for an instant effect regardless of whose turn it is, so long as you have Mana to play it. Once a card has been played as an Instant, it is <em>discarded</em>.</p>
		<p>The suit of the card determines the effect of the Instant:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Spades</strong> give the choice of either:
				<ul>
					<li>Your opponent chooses and <em>discards</em> 1 card from their hand, or</li>
					<li>You deal 1 <em>unavoidable</em> damage to your opponent or one of your opponent's Units</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Hearts</strong> allow you to <em>un-remove</em> 1 card</li>
			<li><strong>Diamonds</strong> allow you to <em>un-discard</em> 1 card of your choice</li>
			<li><strong>Clubs</strong> allow you to choose and <em>discard</em> any Attachment that has a number value less than or equal to its number value</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Combat</h2>
		<p>Face Cards are Units that you summon to attack your opponent and defend you from their Units' attacks. By default, they are considered to have 1 health and 0 attack values. Spade Units on the other hand, have a default attack value of 1.</p>
		<p>You may initiate combat if you have either of the following in your Roster:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An un-tapped Spade Unit, whether it has Attachments or not</li>
			<li>An un-tapped Unit with a Spade Attachment</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When you declare combat, <em>tap</em> any number of Units (and their Attachments) and let your opponent know that you are starting combat. Your opponent then <em>taps</em> any number of un-tapped Units in their Roster to defend, then chooses which of their defenders defends against which if your attackers. Multiple defenders may defend against one attacker, with the defender deciding how to spread the attacker's damage between their Units. The defending play may choose not to assign any defenders.</p>
		<p><em>Tapped</em> Units may not attack or defend while they remain tapped.</p>
		<p>Combat damage is determined for both attacker and defender(s) simultaneously. To assess combat damage, compare any attached Spade card's number value with the opposite combatant's attached Heart card's number value. If one or both of these Attachments are missing, refer to the defaults above.</p>
		<p>Any Unit that has a lower Heart value than their opposite combatant's Spade value is killed, and is <em>discarded</em> at the end of combat. If their Heart value is higher, they survive and are not <em>discarded</em>.</p>
		<p>Once survivors and casualties have been determined, resolve any other effects from Diamond or Club Attachments from both sides.</p>
		<p>Once combat and all effects have been resolved, <em>discard</em> all Attachments from all Units involved, then <em>discard</em> all Units who have been killed.</p>
		<p>If there is any damage that was not defended, it is dealt as damage to the opponent by <em>removing</em> cards from their Draw Pile. A round of combat could theoretically end with both players taking damage, though you should attempt to minimize this occurance by being strategic in your Attachments and how/when you attack or defend.</p>
		
		<h3>Unavoidable Damage</h3>
		<p>Some damage is <em>unavoidable</em>, which means that it directly affects your opponent's health without the opportUnity to be defended against.</p>
		<p>Unavoidable damage is always assessed after all other sources of damage, if any, have been resolved.</p>
		
		<h2>Jokers</h2>
		<p>Jokers are a rare commodity, and have particularly powerful effects that are different depending on how you choose to play them.</p>
		<p>Jokers cost 1 Mana of any color to play.</p>
		<p>Jokers played as an Instant are a <em>counterspell</em>, causing your opponent to <em>discard</em> a card of your choosing that they are in the process of playing. Once an Instant Joker is played, it is <em>discarded</em>.</p>
		<p>Jokers played as Attachments make the attached Unit's damage <em>unavoidable</em> for one combat session, after which the Joker Attachment is <em>discarded</em>. Attachment Jokers cannot be removed by Instant Club effects.</p>
		<p>Jokers that are <em>discarded</em> are removed from the game entirely, do not go into your Draw Pile or Void Pile, and cannot be played again.</p>
		
		<h2>Course of Play</h2>
		<p>The game is played in turns, alternating between you and your opponents. Determine who goes first by drawing a card from your deck and comparing the value; the player with the highest value goes first. If more than 2 opponents are present, the order of play goes to the right of the first player, or some other method that the group agrees to.</p>
		<p>When play starts, each player draws 5 cards as a starting Hand. Over the course of play, you may have any number of cards in your hand-there is no minimum or maximum.</p>
		<p>When your turn begins, you must perform the following actions in order:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Draw a card from your Draw Pile,</li>
			<li><em>Un-tap</em> all of your tapped cards,</li>
			<li>Play 1 Mana, if you have any to play</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You may then perform any number of the following actions as long as you have cards in your Hand to play and Mana to spend:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tap Mana</li>
			<li>Play Units</li>
			<li>Play Instants</li>
			<li>Play Attachments</li>
			<li>Declare combat</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Declaring combat must be the last action that you take on your turn. Once combat has been resolved, or when you decide not to declare combat, your turn is over.</p>
		<p>Any player may play an Instant during any player's turn.</p>
		
		<h3>Mulligan</h3>
		<p>Any player may shuffle the first Hand of the game back into their Draw Pile and re-draw 5 cards one time in order to try for a better starting hand.</p>
		
		<h3>Loss Condition</h3>
		<p>Any player who cannot draw a card from their Draw Pile at the beginning of their turn loses the game.</p>
		
		<h3>Example Combat</h3>
		<p>My Unit:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Jack of Diamonds
				<ul>
					<li>5 of Spades</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Your Unit:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				King of Hearts
				<ul>
					<li>3 of Hearts</li>
					<li>6 of Diamonds</li>
					<li>2 of Clubs</li>
					<li>4 of Clubs</li>
					<li>6 of Clubs</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I declare combat by <em>tapping</em> my Jack. My Jack's 5 of Spades Attachment means it has an attack value of 5, but it has no Heart Attachment, meaning it has the default of 1 health. You <em>tap</em> your King as a defender. Your King has 3 health, and 1 unavoidable damage, but is not a Spade, nor does it have a Spade Attachment, so it has the default 0 attack value.</p>
		<p>My Jack does 5 damage to your King, who absorbs 3 damage because of its health value, but unfortunately dies without doing any damage to me or my Jack. That leaves 2 un-defended damage that are applied to you. Your King has a Diamond Attachment, which applies 1 unavoidable damage to me.</p>
		<p><strong>Results</strong>: My Jack lives, but your King dies. All Attachments on both Units are discarded. You take 2 damage, while I take 1 damage. Since your King died while carrying 3 Spade Attachments, you now <em>un-discard</em> 3 cards from your Discard Pile into your Hand.</p>
		
		<h1>Appendix A: Advanced Rules</h1>
		<p>You may decide with your fellow players to implement any of these rules to expand play, make it easier or more complicated. It is not likely that these are balanced in any way, so proceed at your own risk.</p>
		
		<h3>Graveyard</h3>
		<p>The Void Pile no longer exists. Any card that would be <em>removed</em> is instead <em>discarded</em> to the Discard Pile. This means that dealing damage to your opponents puts more cards into their Discard Pile, which they can pick and choose out of when <em>un-discarding</em>. Similarly, <em>un-removing</em> takes cards from the top of the Discard Pile and places them on the top of the Draw Pile.</p>
		
		<h3>Free For All</h3>
		<p>Any card can be played as a Unit, Attachment, or Instant. When played as an Attachment or Instant, Aces have a value of 1, Jacks have a value of 11, Queens have a value of 12, and Kings have a value of 13</p>
		<p>If playing with Picky Units, Units may only have Attachments less than or equal to their value.</p>
		
		<h3>Strong Houses</h3>
		<p>If you have three out of the four Unit types (King, Queen, Jack, Ace) in your Roster with the same suit, they all receive benefits from all Attachments on those cards, cumulatively, but they all lose their Attachments whenever one of their same-suited Units attacks, even if only one is chosen as an attacker.</p>
			
		<h3>Hand Size</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Minimum Hand:</strong> At the beginning of your turn, you must draw up to 5 cards. If you have 5 or more cards already, draw 1 card as normal. This causes games to end quicker, but you will overall have more options per turn</li>
			<li><strong>Maximum Hand:</strong> At the end of your turn, you must discard down to 5 cards. This forces you to be more strategic with your play choices and consider which cards are okay to discard</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Advanced Units Rules</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Unlimited Units:</strong> You are no longer restricted to one Face Card of each type</li>
			<li><strong>Hierarchical Units:</strong> You may have one King, two Queens, three Jacks, and four Aces in play at a time</li>
			<li><strong>Picky Units:</strong> Aces may only have Attachments up to a value of 3; Jacks may have up to a value of 5; Queens may have up to a value of 7; Kings may have any value</li>
			<li><strong>Rank-specific Units:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Kings:</strong> Treat Heart Attachments as having a value of 10</li>
					<li><strong>Queens:</strong> Treat each Diamond Attachment as two cards</li>
					<li><strong>Jacks:</strong> Treat Spade Attachments as having a value of 10</li>
					<li><strong>Aces:</strong> Treat each Club Attachment as two cards</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Suit-specific Units:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Spades:</strong> Don't come into play tapped</li>
					<li><strong>Hearts:</strong> Cannot be killed as long as they entered combat with a Heart Attachment</li>
					<li><strong>Clubs:</strong> Can be tapped to force your opponent to tap all of their Club Units</li>
					<li><strong>Diamonds:</strong> Can be sacrificed to <em>un-remove</em> a number of cards based on their rank (King: 4, Queen: 3, Jack: 2, Ace: 1)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
