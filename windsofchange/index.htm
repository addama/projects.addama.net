			<h1>Winds of Change</h1>
			<p>This is a two player game of war, simulated on a small scale using items commonly available. Its basic units are common coins, and because of this, one player is Heads, while the other is Tails. You will each need an army, a battlefield, and a card for measuring distances. Each of these three things are explained below.</p>

			<a id='armies'></a>
			<h1>Armies</h1>
			<p>The basic units are modeled after pocket change. Coins are readily available, and can allow for flexible army building depending on what you have on-hand. If you have no coins available, use your ingenuity to create 2 sets of at least 4 distinct units, with all 4 units preferably being different in size than the rest. Chess sets and modified checkers pieces, for example, could provide a small set of basic units to build 2 armies.</p>

			<!--<p>Advanced units include a large flat rectangle, and a handful of smaller rectangles, smaller than the smallest unit. The 4 basic units, as well as advanced units, are outlined below as a part of the core rules.</p>-->

			<p>Armies are built prior to the game and agreed upon by both players. Although both armies do not need to be identical or even close in terms of power or cost, consider the following Army building rules to agree to before a game:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Limit the number of any unit type(s)</li>
				<li>Allow or disallow advanced units</li>
				<li>Limit the army to a specific dollar value</li>
				<li>Limit the army to a specific unit count</li>
				<li>Limit one army in some way to represent some handicap or disadvantageous condition</li>
			</ul>

			<a id='battlefield'></a>
			<h1>Battlefield</h1>
			<p>Any surface that can units may reliably be placed on can be used as a battlefield. In general, battlefields should be larger than a sheet of notebook paper in order to house armies larger than just a few units each. For larger battlefields, you may wish to play a High Power game, or you'll spend most of your time moving units, and less fighting with them.</p>

			<p>Before play, both players must agree on areas that are considered "high ground," if any, which give units a Cover Bonus (below). Each player must also place their bases and other permanent structures before the battle begins. Establish and agree to terrain features such as water, mud, lava, impassible terrain, view-obstructing walls/placements, etc. Any of these features may be represented by real items, markings on the battleground itself, or other obvious ways.</p>

			<h1>Mechanics</h1>

			<a id='distances'></a>
			<h2>Distances</h2>
			<p>There are 4 distances used in the game. Three of them involve measurements using a standard wallet card (credit/debit card, loyalty card, driver's license, etc). The third uses the coin itself, and is only used in special situations. All measurements are made from the center of the coin. In the case of attacking and moving, you don't have to move the full distance if you don't want to. Distances may be modified by numbers, increasing the total distance. For example, 2L means a distance equal to twice the normal L distance in a straight line.</p>

			<p>The minimum distance used for determining if units and areas (specifically) overlap is 2 millimeters. Use the thickness of a Nickel to estimate this. If less than 2mm of overlap occurs, the unit is not considered inside the area. This is used primarily for explosions, and determining if a unit is inside or outside of a building. Units that are physically touching each other are in contact regardless of any overlap.</p>

			<p>Before play, all players must agree on the measurement card(s) being used, or all use the same one.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>S</strong>: The short side of a card. Depending on the card, it will be just over 2 inches.</li>
				<li><strong>L</strong>: The long side of a card. It is roughly 33% longer than 1S.</li>
				<li><strong>D</strong>: The diagonal distance between far corners of a card. This is roughly 2S, and slightly longer than 1L.</li>
				<li><strong>C</strong>: The diameter of the coin itself.</li>
				<li><strong>*</strong>: Unlimited distance, anywhere on the battlefield.</li>
				<li><strong>LOS</strong>: Line of Sight. The distance is unlimited, but there must be an uninterrupted straight line in between the units.
			</ul>

			<a id='damage'></a>
			<h2>Damage</h2>

			<p>All units have a Toughness value. This, rather than a simple health pool, represents the number of units that must attack it in the span of a single turn in order to kill it. For Pennies and Dimes, this is just 1. For larger units like Nickels and Quarters, that number can be anywhere from 2 to 5. In the special case of units with Toughness 5, the highest value, they may additionally be killed by another Toughness 5 unit's attack, plus two more attacks of any kind, or two attacks from other Toughness 5 units. For example, a Quarter has 5 Toughness, meaning it can be killed by: 5 individual attacks in a single turn; another Quarter plus any other 2 units; or two Quarter attacks. Nickels in low power games (i.e. Horse) has a maximum of 3 Toughness, and is therefore not susceptible to that special rule. Rules for individual units may modify or replace these basic rules.</p>

			<p>Players may damage their own units and buildings, obeying the same rules. It may be better to destroy a tank rather than allow your enemy to use it against you...</p>

			<a id='cover'></a>
			<h2>Cover Bonus</h2>
			<p>Units that have a positional advantage relative to other units are given a Cover Bonus. This bonus is relative between 2 units that are engaged in combat, and should be reconsidered for every attack. </p>

			<p>Any Penny or Dime unit that is within a building or on higher ground gains 1 Toughness against units that attack it that are not within the same building or on the same level of ground. Cover bonuses do not stack, and cannot exceed 1 bonus Toughness. Nickels cannot enter buildings, and can only gain Cover Bonus from high ground. Quarters cannot benefit from Cover Bonuses regardless of the source.</p>

			<a id='explosions'></a>
			<h2>Explosions</h2>
			<p>A few units, particularly tanks and advanced units, can create explosions or damage areas on the battlefield. These areas deal a low amount of damage to all units, regardless of what army they belong to, within a specified circle or area. Units are considered affected by the damage if they overlap in any way with the area (a minimum of 2mm). If a unit is the target for an explosion, the circle radiates from the center of the unit. If an specific point on the battlefield is chosen, that point is the center. Cover Bonuses from being inside buildings protect from explosion damage, but not Cover Bonuses from high ground.</p>

			<a id='driving'></a>
			<a id='carrying'></a>
			<a id='operating'></a>
			<h2>Driving, Carrying, and Operating</h2>
			<p>There are 3 physical relationships in the game: Driving, Carrying, and Operating. Driving and Carrying are similar in that they are represented by stacking coins on top of one another. Driving and Operating are similar in that they represent one unit enabling the functions of another unit in place of their own.</p>

			<p>Some units require a <em>Driver</em> to function. You can show this relationship by stacking the Driver on top of the driven unit. The driven unit, unless otherwise specified, requires a Driver in order to move or attack. The Driver replaces their standard attack and movement rules with the rules for the unit they are driving. In general, if a driven unit is fully destroyed, its Driver is killed as well. Additionally, if a driven unit receives 1 less than its total Toughness in a single turn, not enough to destroy it, the Driver is killed. Drivers must take a full turn to start and stop driving. Driven units may only have 1 Driver at a time. Drivers are not targetable, and are assumed to be protected by the unit they are driving.</p>

			<p>Some units may <em>Carry</em> a limited amount of other units, providing protection and transportation across the battlefield. This relationship is shown by stacking all carried units on top of the carrier. The order of the stack does not matter. Carrier units that are destroyed disembark their carried units into the immediate area, unless they are dealt 1 more than their total Toughness. For example, an APC carrying 5 units that receives 5 damage disembarks its units into the battlefield unharmed, but if it receives 6 total damage, all carried units are lost as well. Carried units must take a full turn to embark and disembark from their carrier. Carried units are not targetable, and are assumed to be protected by the Carrier unit.</p>

			<p>Some units may require an <em>Operator</em> in order to function. This is shown by placing a unit within 2mm (the minimum distance) of the unit it wishes to operate. Operating is similar to Driving, except that the Operator may choose at any time to act as themselves rather than as the unit they are operating. For example, a unit operating Artillery may choose to move or fire the artillery OR move away from the Artillery unit to escape an incoming wave of enemies, but never both. Operated units may still only perform their action(s) once per turn, so multiple units crowded around an Artillery unit cannot all take turns bombarding the other side of the map. If an operated unit is moved, its operator moves with it, attempting to stay in the same relative position. Operated units that are destroyed do not kill or affect their Operator, but of course if the Operator is killed, the operated unit can no longer function.</p>

			<a id='units'></a>
			<h1>Basic Units</h1>

			<p>While the Penny and Dime units represent classes of soldier that are persistent across time and technology levels, the Nickel and Quarter units have differing descriptions and mechanics depending on the technological level of your army. For a reference, a Civil War army would use the Low Power units, while a WW2 and newer army would use the High Power units.</p>

			<a id='pennies'></a>
			<h2>Pennies</h2>
			<p>Pennies are your infantry, the ones on the ground with the skills for battle. They may move two separate 1S distances on their turn, or substitute one of those movements for a 1L attack. They may not attack twice in a turn. This versatility allows them extreme mobility, and enables many advanced maneuvers. Infantry Pennies behave the same in low and high power games.</p>
			<p><strong>Toughness</strong>: 1, <strong>Move</strong>: 1S (1S), <strong>Attack</strong>: 1L</p>

			<a id='dimes'></a>
			<h2>Dimes</h2>
			<p>Dimes in high power games are the elite snipers of your army, and in low power games are Riflemen or Archers. They carry long range weaponry, but require time to set up before unleashing their powerful attacks. They may either move one S distance, OR attack any unit that is directly visible to the sniper at any distance. They may not do both in a single turn. For example, units taking shelter in buildings, or are behind terrain or buildings to the sniper's perspective, are not legal targets. If many units are in a row, the sniper may only fire on the closest, as they would intercept the bullet. Dimes behave the same in low and high power games.</p>
			<p><strong>Toughness</strong>: 1, <strong>Move</strong>: 1S, <strong>Attack</strong>: LOS</p>

			<a id='nickels'></a>
			<h2>Nickels, Low Power</h2>
			<p>Nickels in low power games are battle-bred horses, strong and willful companions that Carry their charge deep into the heart of battle. Up to two Pennies or Dimes of the same army may mount the horse. Horses are neutral, and can be used by either army. They may move two L distances per turn, but the units it carries cannot attack until they have dismounted. The Horse cannot attack. Horses have a total Toughness equal to 1 plus however many units it carries, to a maximum of 3. If damage less than its total Toughness is done to a Horse that is carrying units, the Horse dies. Any mounted units are dismounted into the immediate area. Horses cannot enter buildings. </p>
			<p><strong>Toughness</strong>: 1-3, <strong>Move</strong>: 1L (1L), <strong>Attack</strong>: N/A</p>

			<h2>Nickels, High Power</h2>
			<p>Nickels in high power games are armored personnel carriers (APC). They may Carry up to five Pennies or Dimes of the same army at a time. APCs are neutral, and can be used by either army. They may move one L distance per turn. The APC cannot attack. Regardless of how many units it carries, APCs have 5 Toughness. APCs cannot enter buildings, and cannot benefit from Cover Bonuses from any source.</p>
			<p><strong>Toughness</strong>: 5, <strong>Move</strong>: 1L, <strong>Attack</strong>: N/A</p>

			<a id='quarters'></a>
			<h2>Quarters, Low Power</h2>
			<p>Quarters in low power games are mobile artillery, impressive guns on wheeled platforms. Artillery requires an Operator in order to function. They can move 1C, and attack in a column the width of 1S, and the length of 2L (two measuring cards laid end to end). Any unit within this column takes 1 damage. Artillery must choose to either move or attack, but never both in the same turn. Artillery cannot enter buildings, and cannot benefit from Cover Bonuses from any source.</p>
			<p><strong>Toughness</strong>: 5, <strong>Move</strong>: 1C, <strong>Attack</strong>: 1S by 2L Column</p>

			<h2>Quarters, High Power</h2>
			<p>Quarters in high power games are hulking tanks capable of dishing out devastating damage from afar. In order for a Tank to operate, it must be driven by a Penny. Dimes may not drive Tanks. Tanks may either move 1C or shoot an explosive shell at any area that is farther than 1L from themselves. They may not move and attack on the same turn. Tanks may not fire its weapon closer to itself than 1L. Tanks that move into direct contact with another unit deals 2 damage to that unit, running it over. The explosive shell it fires can be targeted anywhere that is legal, and doesn't have to target specific units. Explosive shells deal 1 damage to every unit that overlaps in any amount with a 1S circle around its landing point. Tanks are neutral, and can be operated by either army.</p>
			<p><strong>Toughness</strong>: 5, <strong>Move</strong>: 1C, <strong>Attack</strong>: */Explosive</p>

			<a id='gametypes'></a>
			<h1>Game Types</h1>
			<p>Game types can be broken into two choices: Power and Goal.</p>

			<p>Your first choice when determining game type is Power, either Low Power or High Power. Units may behave differently between these two choices. Low Power games are best for small playing spaces and small armies, and this is reflected in smaller movement or targeting distances. High Power games are better suited for larger battlefields and larger armies. Units are more mobile, attack farther, and are generally more powerful. Each unit outlined below will include high and low power rule changes if they have them.</p>

			<p>The second choice is the game's overall Goal. Consider the following goals, or make up your own:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Domination</strong>: Destroy your opponent's entire army.</li>
				<li><strong>Control</strong>: Occupy all strategic bases on the map for 2-3 turns.</li>
				<li><strong>Assassination</strong>: Units may respawn as long as a single VIP unit remains alive.</li>
				<li><strong>Payload</strong>: Deliver an item (carryable by a single unit) from its origin to your base.</li>
				<li><strong>Convoy</strong>: One player must traverse the map, keeping at least 1 unit alive while the other player attacks.</li>
				<li><strong>Timed</strong>: The player with the most living units at the end of a given time period wins</li>
			</ul>

			<a id='appendix'></a>
			<h1>Appendix</h1>

			<h2>Advanced Units and Features</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Can Tabs</strong>: personal armor, repair kits, grenades, generators</li>
				<li><strong>Bottle Caps</strong>: boats, gliders, mechanized armor, guard towers</li>
				<li><strong>Paper</strong>: bases</li>
				<li><strong>Toothpicks</strong>: fences, walls</li>
				<li><strong>Pencils/Chopsticks</strong>: walls, bridges</li>
			</ul>

			<a id='advancedrules'></a>
			<h2>Advanced Rules</h2>

			<h3>Respawn</h3>
			<p>If you are playing a game that includes a Respawn mechanic, both players must agree to the respawn point(s) each army will use, as well as the conditions that either stop units from respawning or some way to win despite the infinite units. Ideally, these respawn points will be well back from the center of the battlefield, such that respawned units require some travel to rejoin the fray.</p>

			<h3>Squad Formations</h3>
			<p>Penny units may combine into a stack of up to 5, increasing their total Toughness to the amount of units in the Squad. The Squad retains the movement rules for Pennies, but attacks as if all members were attacking at once. Squads may be separated, but must dedicate an entire turn to do so, placing all members as close to the original Squad position as possible. Similarly, forming a Squad takes an entire turn. Squads may absorb individual units, or even other squads, as long as the total units in the final stack are 5 or less. Regardless of the number of units absorbed, it still takes an entire turn. Squads may not ride, operate, carry, or drive other units, such as Nickels and Quarters, unless the number of members in the Squad is less than or equal to the carry/driver capacity for the target unit. Squads may enter buildings that have the capacity to hold all of its members as if all of the units were trying to enter the building individually.</p>

			<p>Units being carried may disembark from their carrier directly into a squad, or several squads.</p>

			<p>Dime units may group up into pairs, allowing attacks to hit any unit taking shelter in bases in addition to their normal targets, dealing 1 damage and ignoring Cover Bonus from buildings. All other Squad and Dime rules apply. The Squad's Toughness remains at 1.</p>

			<p>A Dime and a Penny may pair up into a Squad, increasing their Toughness to 2. The Squad may move 1S per turn, or deal 2 damage to any unit within 1L distance. All other Squad rules apply.</p>

			<h3>Water</h3>
			<p>If an area of your battlefield is declared as a river, ocean, or other large body of water, your units will understandably have trouble crossing it. Halve any movement distance while inside a water area, to a minimum of 1C. Additionally, all units may only shoot or move on their turn regardless of their original rules.</p>

			<h1>To Do</h1>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Define advanced units</strong>: Things like grenades, boats, and watchtowers have had different rules and takes over the years in this system, so I need to consolidate those and present them here.</li>
				<li><strong>Generate example armies</strong>: This is something I had done in the past, which was to lay out some armies both by the number of units, and the amount of money the army represents, and then giving those armies names so they're recognizable. This would facilitate, for example, an easy "1 Dollar Campaign" where your armies must equal a dollar.</li>
				<li><strong>Simplify the rules</strong>: Right now, how damage works, it's very easy for one side to lose enough units that they can't possibly win anymore. That was somewhat intentional, as the idea was to play quick battles on a bus ride, not to have a long and drawn out campaign. However, that's probably not as satisfying as it could be.</li>
				<li><strong>Add optional dice rules</strong>: I purposefully avoided non-pocket items to reduce the amount of things needed to get started in the game. Right now you just need the rules and some change. But with at least one die (probably 6 sided), I could expand the game mechanics quite a bit.</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Version History</h1>
			<p>This system has been floating around in my head and in text files and draft emails for years. I can trace it back to at least 2013, but I have a feeling there's a text file somewhere on my backup harddrive that is much, much older.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>20181009</strong>: Dumped the latest draft email version into HTML format.</li>
				<li><strong>20181010</strong>: Formalized HTML format, rearranged sections a little bit, as well as some small quality additions.</li>
			</ul>
